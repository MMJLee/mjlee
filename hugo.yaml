            I am a software developer with a background in engineering and mathematics. Coding and debugging has always stimulated my brain like no other,
            and after working a bit as a mechanical engineer, I decided that I'd rather spend the rest of my life in the world of software. Since 
            then, I've continued to develop my skills and experiment with new technologies. 

            I prefer working in the backend and enjoy formulating complex SQL queries.

            Lately I'm experimenting with SSR using Go (html/template) and HTMX.
